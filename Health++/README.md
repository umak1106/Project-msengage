# Health++

Health++ is an app which uses opencv and other machine learning based algorithms to provide the following features .<br>
It is deployed on streamlit cloud.

## Installation 

git clone this repo 

OR

git clone https://github.com/Uk1106/Repo2.git <br>
Uk1106 is my 2nd github account .

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```streamlit run app.py```


## Face Mask Detection :
Caffe model is the pre-trained deep learning model used to detect faces.<br>
For Face mask detection I have used pre-trained keras CNN model as shown in the article [here](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/).
<br>OpencV is used to detect faces and CNN model to classify if mask  is present or not .
